    1)  student.name
    2)  student['Grad Year'] 
    3)  student.greeting()
    4)  student['Favorite Teacher'].name
    5)  student.courseLoad[0]
13) Arithmetic
    1) 32 because 2 will be treated a string and they will be concatenated
    2) 1 because '3' will be treated as a number because there is no string subtraction
    3) 3 because null will be treated as 0
    4) 3null because null will be treated as a string
    5) 4 because true has a value of 1
    6) 0 because both false and null are 0
    7) 3undefined because undefined will be treated as a string 
    8) NaN because there is no string subtraction and undefined has no value unlike null
14) Comparison
    1)  True because 2 will be converted to a number and 2>1
    2)  True because it is a string comparison and the first index of '2' is greater than '12' ('1')
    3)  True because '==' will convert '2' to 2
    4)  False because '===' is a strict equality operator so they must be the same
    5)  False because True is equal to 1 and 1 !=2
    6)  True because boolean(2) is equal to one because 2 is greater than 0
15) '==' ignores the datatype of the variable while '===' will check the datatype
16) In javascript file
17) The result will be [2,4,6]. We call modifyArray with [1,2,3] as the first parameter and doSomething as the second parameter. We use a for loop to iterate through the array by index and we add it to another array newArr after we transform the item with doSomething.
