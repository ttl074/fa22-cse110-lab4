1) 20
2) 20
3) Error because the result variable is only accessible in the if block. The second result variable will not be defined. 
4) Error because the result variable is only accessible in the if block. The second result variable will not be defined.
5) Error because we are trying to reassign a const variable. 
6) Error because we are trying to reassign a const variable. 
###Part 2
1) 3 will be printed because i will be post-incremented and the loop will run 3 times, so i will be incremented 3 times.
2) It will output 150 because in the last iteration of the for loop, the input for discounted price is 150.
3) 150 because the last time finalprice is updated in the for loop, the value is 150.  
4) It will return an array with the values [50,100,150] because finalprice is added to the array after each for loop iteration
5) Error because i is only accessible in the for loop block. 
6) Error because discountedPrice is only accessible in the for loop block.
7) It will print 150 because the scope of finalPrice is the entire function block.
8) It will return an array with the values [50,100,150] because discounted is accessible for the entire function block. 
9) It won't even reach the line because when reassigning the value of discountedPrice an error will be thrown.
10) It won't even reach the line because when reassigning the value of discountedPrice an error will be thrown.
11) It won't return anything because when reassigning the value of discountedPrice an error will be thrown.
